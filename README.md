We investigated how to increase the chance of winning a game of chess by analyzing numerous factors affecting the outcome of a chess game. To explore this topic two datasets had been selected and using softwareâ€™s like excel and python relevant data will be analyzed to relate them to conclude which strategies can be used to increase the chance of winning the game of chess. Factors like color, rating, time, opening move, and type of games had been related to the winning probability. The conclusion was that there may not exist any one definitive strategy to win, however, white pieces tend to have an advantage in most cases. But with more resources and time other non-measurable and measurable factors can be investigated to either justify or contradict such a conclusion. The usefulness of the study can range from something small like understanding how to win chess to something large like, how visualization and analysis of game data can be used to devise artificial intelligence that can compute strategies that can be used to win a game of chess against any players depending on any situation.
